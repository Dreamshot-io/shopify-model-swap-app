## Vercel Migration Plan for Shopify Remix App

### Objective

Migrate the Remix-based Shopify app to Vercelâ€™s serverless platform following Shopify and Vercel best practices. Ensure stateless operation, reliable persistence, and performance within serverless constraints.

### Summary of Required Changes

- Migrate database from SQLite to PostgreSQL (serverless-friendly).
- Optimize Prisma client for serverless and connection pooling.
- Add Vercel adapter for Remix with a single serverless entry function and rewrites.
- Provide complete environment variable setup for Vercel.
- Keep S3-compatible storage (R2) and fal.ai as-is.
- Optionally improve long-running upload flows (reduce polling / background).

### Assumptions

- PostgreSQL is provisioned (Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase, or RDS with pooling).
- We will use a pooled connection string or Prisma Accelerate compatible setup.

### Phased Plan

#### Phase 1: Database & Prisma

- Switch `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource to PostgreSQL via `env("DATABASE_URL")`.
- Add `DATABASE_URL` to env types and provide `.env` bootstrap (`scripts/init-env.sh`).
- Ensure Prisma client initialization is serverless-safe (singleton reuse across invocations).
- Add `prisma generate` to build, `postinstall`, and `vercel-build` scripts.
- Create initial Postgres baseline migration; archive old SQLite migrations.
- Add migration scripts and CI workflow for `prisma migrate deploy` (with skip guard if `DATABASE_URL` is missing).

Risks:

- Schema differences between SQLite and Postgres (types/indexes). Validate migrations and adjust if needed.

#### Phase 2: Runtime & Adapter

- Add Vercel adapter entry using `@remix-run/node` (Remix v2 no longer requires `@remix-run/vercel`).
- Import the server build via `virtual:remix/server-build` and set handler `mode`.
- Add `vercel.json` rewrites routing all traffic to the Remix handler and set Node runtime/maxDuration.

Risks:

- Edge runtime is not suitable due to Node-only deps (Prisma, AWS SDK). Use Node runtime.

#### Phase 3: Upload & Long-running Ops (Optional/Next)

- Current polling for file processing can approach function timeouts under load.
- Options:
    - Reduce polling or add exponential backoff.
    - Switch to webhook-based completion from Shopify to avoid active polling.
    - Use background function or queue for long tasks.

#### Phase 4: Operational Readiness

- Configure all environment variables in Vercel (add SSL params to `DATABASE_URL` if required, e.g., `?sslmode=require`).
- Update `shopify.app.toml` `application_url` and App Proxy URL after first deploy.
- Set up logging/monitoring (e.g., Vercel logs, Sentry).
- Smoke test auth, webhooks, uploads, and proxy route.

Skip Guards (safety):

- GitHub Action for migrations now checks `secrets.DATABASE_URL`; if not set, it skips migrate deploy.
- Local `migrate:dev` / `migrate:deploy` scripts no-op when `DATABASE_URL` is not set.

### Implementation TODO (Checklist)

- [x] Switch Prisma datasource to PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL` in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [x] Update Prisma client initialization for serverless reuse in `app/db.server.ts`
- [x] Provide env bootstrap (`scripts/init-env.sh`) and update `env.d.ts`
- [x] Add `postinstall` (prisma generate) and `vercel-build` scripts in `package.json`
- [x] Prepare `vercel.json` with rewrites and function config
- [x] Add Vercel Remix adapter entry (Node runtime)
- [x] Add GitHub Action for `migrate deploy` with skip guard for missing `DATABASE_URL`
- [ ] Configure Vercel environment variables and secrets (incl. SSL params)
- [ ] Update `shopify.app.toml` URLs to Vercel domain post-deploy
- [ ] Validate and, if needed, optimize file upload flow for serverless
- [ ] Add monitoring/logging and run readiness checks

New Items:

- [x] Create initial Postgres baseline migration and archive old SQLite migrations
- [x] Add Docker Compose local Postgres and docs (`prd/DEV-DB-POSTGRES.md`)
- [x] Add safe local migration scripts that no-op if `DATABASE_URL` missing
- [ ] Choose pooling strategy (e.g., Neon pgbouncer or Prisma Accelerate) and update `DATABASE_URL`
- [ ] Add seed script and sample data; document `bun run db:seed`
- [ ] Add E2E checklist for staging validation

### Rollback Plan

- Keep a branch with SQLite config for local dev if needed.
- If Postgres migration fails, revert datasource and redeploy previous version.

### Success Criteria

- All routes and webhooks respond on Vercel without timeouts.
- Database read/write succeeds with pooled connections.
- File uploads complete successfully; no blocked threads or timeouts.
- Shopify embedded app loads and App Proxy endpoint functions correctly.
