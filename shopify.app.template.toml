# Template for multi-client Shopify app configuration
# Copy this file to shopify.app.<client-slug>.toml and replace placeholders
#
# Usage:
#   1. cp shopify.app.template.toml shopify.app.cliente-a.toml
#   2. Replace ${CLIENT_SLUG_ID} with actual client_id from Partner Dashboard
#   3. Replace ${CLIENT_SLUG_SECRET} with actual client_secret (stored in env vars)
#   4. Verify all ${SHOPIFY_APP_URL} references point to shared backend
#   5. Commit the new config file (secrets should reference env vars, not hardcoded values)
